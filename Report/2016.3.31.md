# Report 160331

## Summary
This week I made a more dense hair model with 15k strands and run the first half of the pipeline. The rest of the pipeline is still running and the reports maybe available in the late of 1st April.

I also corrected some mistakes, one of which is caused by misunderstanding of the paper equation 8. This mistakes causes in general less guide hairs for each normal hair, and dramatically increased the reconstruction error. A few incomplete test (e.g. sample only 10 frames) indicates that after solving the mistake, the reconstruction error appear to be not related to the guide hair selection.

Guide selection: worst
